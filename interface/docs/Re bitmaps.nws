What do you specifically mean by "I can't get out the 10x10 bitmap..."?
Eh... what is holding you <g>?

Both bitmaps have to be DibSections. The beauty of dib sections is that you
can hit them as regular, device-specific GDI objects (via bitblit in this
case) yet they also provide an easy access to the binary data. Them binary
data are what you need in order to save a bitmap as a dib to disk--the
blahblah infoheader will the file's header (after blah blah fileheader, of
course), and then the bits will be the actual data. 

Remember, when you hit HBITMAPs (like in bitblits) you operate on
DDBitmaps, whose format is basically a "black-box" to you. Not suitable for
saving externally. 

Now, as an extra comment, there *are* functions to get binary data out of
DDBs (GetBitmapData...?...Bits? Can't remember. Search the help) and if you
go that route, those will be the data that are DIB-like and you can use
them for saving. But I'd not worry about this and simply used two Dib
Sections. This has got to be the simplest way.
