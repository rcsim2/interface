That's what I thought.

Same here.

Yes.
I'm doing it more or less just for fun. It's supposed to be for FMS
the free model flight simulator (http://simulator.home.pages.de)
I offered the author that he can use it in his program.

I also want to extend it to be a joystick driver, so that every
DirectInput program can use it.

At the moment I have two test apps which open the VxD and do IOCTLs
to it to read the channel timings. One console version which printf's
the numbers and one MFC app with progress controls for the channels.

I'm still thinking about an elegant way to select the port dynamically
instead of hardcoded IO/IRQ addresses.
I wrote a function that enumerates the ports through
_VCOMM_Enumerate_DevNodes and uses configuration manager services
to find out the IO address and IRQ, but it isn't used yet.

If you want, I can send you my sources as they are at the moment.

Peter
